# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Analysis Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to determine if paid reviews are biased in the Amazon pet product dataset.

## Results
### The analysis showed the following results (https://github.com/awolfe95/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Amazon_Vine_Analysis.png): 
* There were 170 Vine reviews and 37840 non-Vine reviews.
* There were 65 Vine 5 star reviews and 20612 non-Vine 5 star reviews.
* Approximately 38% of Vine reviews were 5 stars, while approximately 54% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

## Summary
### Based on the analysis comparing 5 star Vine reviews vs. non-Vine 5 star reviews, bias is not apparent. The percentage of 5 star reviews is actually less for the Vine reviews than the non-Vine reviews, meaning that non-paid reviews actually had more 5 stars than paid reviews. Another analysis to check bias would be to potentially expand the star rating from just 5 star reviews to 4 and 5 star reviews and calculate the percentage Vine vs. non-Vine from that as well. Additionally, we could examine the percentage of 1 star reviews in Vine vs non-Vine reviews, because it would also be interesting to compare if paid reviewers actually gave out 1 star reviews.
